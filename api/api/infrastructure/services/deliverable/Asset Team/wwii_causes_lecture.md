## Today's Learning Goals
- Understand the multiple causes that led to WWII
- Analyze the failure of the League of Nations
- Examine the rise of totalitarian regimes
- Connect WWI aftermath to WWII origins

## I. Introduction: The "Twenty Years' Crisis"

Good morning class. Today we're discussing what historian E.H. Carr called the **"Twenty Years' Crisis"** - the period between WWI and WWII (1919-1939).

### Key Question for Today:
*Was WWII inevitable after WWI, or could it have been prevented?*

---

## II. Long-Term Causes (1919-1933)

### A. Treaty of Versailles and Its Consequences

The **Treaty of Versailles** (1919) created lasting resentment in Germany:

**War Guilt Clause** (Article 231): Germany forced to accept full responsibility for the war. As historian Fritz Stern noted, "The treaty was designed to keep Germany weak, but instead it made Germany angry."

**Reparations**: Germany required to pay massive war reparations. The exact amount was set at 132 billion gold marks in 1921 - approximately $400 billion in today's currency.

**Territorial Losses**: 
- Alsace-Lorraine returned to France
- Saar Basin placed under League of Nations control
- Polish Corridor created, separating East Prussia from Germany
- All German colonies redistributed as League mandates

**Military Restrictions**:
- German army limited to 100,000 men
- No air force permitted
- Navy restricted to 6 battleships, no submarines
- Rhineland to be permanently demilitarized

### B. Economic Instability

**Hyperinflation** in Germany (1921-1923): The German mark became virtually worthless. A loaf of bread that cost 250 marks in January 1923 cost 200 billion marks by November 1923.

**Great Depression** (1929-1939): Global economic collapse that hit Germany particularly hard. "By 1932, over 6 million Germans were unemployed - nearly 30% of the workforce" (Economic History Review, 2019).

## III. Rise of Totalitarian Regimes

### A. Fascism in Italy

**Benito Mussolini** and the **Fascist Party** rose to power in 1922:
- Promised to restore Italian greatness and recreate a Roman Empire
- Used violence and intimidation through **Blackshirts** paramilitary groups
- Established the first fascist dictatorship in Europe

**Key Fascist Principles**:
- Extreme nationalism
- Rejection of democracy and liberalism  
- Glorification of violence and war
- Cult of personality around the leader

### B. Nazism in Germany

**Adolf Hitler** and the **Nazi Party** (NSDAP):
- Gained support during economic crisis
- Hitler appointed Chancellor in January 1933
- Quickly dismantled democratic institutions

**Nazi Ideology**:
- **Racial supremacy**: Belief in Aryan racial superiority
- **Lebensraum**: "Living space" - need for German territorial expansion
- **Anti-Semitism**: Systematic persecution of Jewish people
- **Führerprinzip**: Absolute authority of the leader

**Key Events**:
- 1933: Hitler becomes Chancellor, Enabling Act passed
- 1934: Night of the Long Knives, Hitler becomes Führer
- 1935: Nuremberg Laws enacted
- 1938: Kristallnacht ("Night of Broken Glass")

### C. Militarism in Japan

**Japanese Expansionism**:
- Military-dominated government seeking empire in Asia
- Belief in Japanese racial and cultural superiority
- Economic need for raw materials and markets

**Key Aggressive Actions**:
- 1931: Invasion of Manchuria
- 1937: Second Sino-Japanese War begins
- 1940: Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy

## IV. Immediate Causes (1933-1939)

### A. Failure of Collective Security

**League of Nations** proved ineffective:
- No enforcement mechanism for its decisions
- Major powers (US, USSR) not members
- Failed to stop Japanese invasion of Manchuria
- Failed to prevent Italian invasion of Ethiopia (1935)

As Winston Churchill observed in 1938: "The League of Nations has passed from shadow into ghost, from ghost into shadow, and from shadow into nothing."

### B. Policy of Appeasement

**Appeasement**: Policy of making concessions to aggressive powers to avoid war.

**Key Examples**:
- 1936: Germany remilitarizes Rhineland (no response)
- 1938: **Anschluss** - Germany annexes Austria
- 1938: **Munich Agreement** - Sudetenland given to Germany

**Munich Conference** (September 1938):
- British PM Neville Chamberlain declared "peace for our time"
- Czechoslovakia not consulted about loss of Sudetenland
- Demonstrated Western unwillingness to confront Hitler

### C. Breakdown of Diplomacy

**Nazi-Soviet Pact** (August 23, 1939):
- Non-aggression agreement between Hitler and Stalin
- Secret protocol divided Poland between Germany and USSR
- Removed threat of two-front war for Germany

**Polish Guarantee** (March 1939):
- Britain and France promised to defend Poland
- Marked end of appeasement policy
- Set stage for WWII when Germany invaded Poland

---

## V. The Final Crisis: September 1939

### September 1, 1939: Germany Invades Poland
- **Blitzkrieg** ("lightning war") tactics used
- New form of warfare combining tanks, aircraft, and motorized infantry
- Polish forces overwhelmed within weeks

### September 3, 1939: Britain and France Declare War
- Honored their guarantee to Poland
- Marked beginning of WWII in Europe
- Initially a "Phoney War" with little actual fighting

## VI. Historical Interpretations

### A. Intentionalist vs. Functionalist Debate

**Intentionalists** argue:
- Hitler had a clear plan for war from the beginning
- WWII was inevitable once Nazis came to power
- War was result of deliberate Nazi policy

**Functionalists** argue:
- War resulted from cumulative radicalization
- Hitler was responding to circumstances, not following master plan
- Multiple factors and actors contributed to outbreak

### B. Role of Economic Factors

Economic historian Adam Tooze argues: "The Nazi economy was structured around preparation for war. By 1939, Germany faced a choice between war and economic collapse."

## VII. Conclusion: Lessons for Today

### Key Takeaways:
1. **Multiple Causation**: WWII resulted from complex interaction of factors
2. **Importance of International Cooperation**: Failure of League showed need for effective international institutions
3. **Dangers of Appeasement**: Concessions to aggressors may encourage further aggression
4. **Economic-Political Connection**: Economic instability can fuel political extremism

### Discussion Question:
"Could stronger international institutions have prevented WWII, or were the underlying tensions too great?"

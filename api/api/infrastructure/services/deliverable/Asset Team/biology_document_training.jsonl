For instance, muscle cells, which require substantial energy for contraction, contain a higher number of mitochondria compared to skin cells.\n\n**Metaphor:** Mitochondria can be likened to a power plant within a city (the cell). Just as a power plant generates electricity to power homes and businesses, mitochondria generate ATP to fuel cellular activities.\n\n**True/False Question:** True or False: Mitochondria are only found in prokaryotic cells.  \n**Answer:** False. Mitochondria are found only in eukaryotic cells.\n\n---\n\n#### Term: Cell Theory\n**Definition:** The cell theory is a foundational principle in biology that encompasses three core tenets: (1) all living organisms are composed of one or more cells, (2) the cell is the basic unit of life, and (3) all cells arise from pre-existing cells. This theory underscores the significance of cells as the building blocks of life and provides a unifying framework for understanding the structure and function of living organisms.\n\n**Related Terms:** Cell, prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells, nucleus.\n\n**Real-World Example:** The cell theory is supported by extensive research, including the observation that \"the human body contains approximately 37.2 trillion cells,\" illustrating the vast complexity and cellular composition of multicellular organisms.\n\n**Metaphor:** The cell theory can be compared to the foundational rules of a game.

Concentration gradient\n\n**Examples:**\n- **Sodium-Potassium Pump:** Actively transports sodium ions out of the cell and potassium ions into the cell.\n- **Glucose Transport:** Cells can actively transport glucose into the cell even when glucose concentrations are higher inside.\n\n**Everyday Object Analogy:** Active transport can be likened to a person pushing a heavy object uphill, requiring effort (energy) to move against gravity (concentration gradient).\n\n**Multiple Choice Question:**\nWhat is a characteristic of active transport?\nA) It does not require energy.  \nB) It moves substances down their concentration gradient.  \nC) It requires ATP.  \nD) It occurs only in prokaryotic cells.  \n**Correct Answer:** C) It requires ATP.\n\n---\n\nThis study guide provides a comprehensive overview of key terms in cell and molecular biology, enhancing understanding through definitions, examples, analogies, and recall questions.", "concept_bin": "Biology: Cell & Molecular",

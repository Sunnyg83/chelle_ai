The derivative of a function gives us the slope of the tangent line to the curve at any point, which represents the rate of change of the function.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to calculating the derivative of x^2:\n\n1. **Power Rule**: The Power Rule states that if you have a function in the form of f(x) = x^n, where n is a constant, the derivative f'(x) is given by f'(x) = n * x^(n-1). \n\n2. **Apply the Power Rule**: For f(x) = x^2, we have n = 2. So, we apply the Power Rule:\n   - f'(x) = 2 * x^(2-1)\n   - f'(x) = 2 * x^1\n   - f'(x) = 2x\n\n3. **Interpretation**: This means that the slope of the tangent line to the curve y = x^2 at any point x is equal to 2x. For example, at x = 1, the slope is 2(1) = 2, and at x = 2, the slope is 2(2) = 4.\n\nTo visualize this, you can think of the graph of y = x^2, which is a parabola opening upwards.

The derivative of a function gives us the slope of the tangent line to the curve at any point, which tells us how the function is changing at that point.\n\nFor the function f(x) = x^2, we can apply the power rule, which states that if you have a term in the form of x^n, the derivative is n*x^(n-1). In this case, n is 2.\n\n1. Start with f(x) = x^2.\n2. According to the power rule, the derivative f'(x) = 2*x^(2-1) = 2*x^1 = 2x.\n\nSo, the derivative of x^2 is f'(x) = 2x. \n\nTo visualize this, imagine a parabola that opens upwards. At any point on this curve, the slope (or steepness) of the tangent line can be found using the derivative. For example:\n- At x = 1, f'(1) = 2(1) = 2, meaning the slope of the tangent line at that point is 2.\n- At x = 0, f'(0) = 2(0) = 0, meaning the slope is flat at the vertex of the parabola.\n\nThis shows how the slope changes depending on where you are on the curve.\n\nTo connect this to a related idea, consider the concept of **critical points**.

The slope of the tangent line at any point on this curve is given by the derivative. For example, if you take the point \\( x = 1 \\), the derivative \\( 2(1) = 2 \\) tells you that the slope of the tangent line at that point is 2. This means that if you were to draw a line that just touches the curve at \\( (1, 1) \\), it would be rising at a rate of 2 units vertically for every 1 unit you move horizontally.\n\nNow, let\u2019s connect this to a related concept: the idea of a tangent line. The derivative at a point gives you the slope of the tangent line at that point.
